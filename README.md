Assignment: Write a well-documented Java program that will simulate a Powerball lottery. Your program will automatically generate a winning Powerball ticket at the beginning of each game. A player will start with $1,000.00 and can purchase any number of $2 Powerball tickets until they decide to quit, or they run out of money. You must compare each lottery number on the player’s ticket to every lottery number on the winning ticket – sequence is not important. Lastly, you will compare the winning Powerball number to the Powerball number on the player’s ticket.
